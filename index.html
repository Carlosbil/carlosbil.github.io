        <h2>About me</h2>
        <div class="project">
            <p>Hello everybody and welcome to my web page. I'm Carlos Bilbao, computer engineer by the Universidad
                Politécnica de Madrid, and
                I'm currently studying a Master in Artificial Intelligence at the Universidad Alfonso X el sabio. I love
                learning new things, improving myself, and giving the best of me in every
                project I
                participate in. I am always looking for ways to improve different projects and determine the best
                approach
                for each problem.</p>
            <p>Throughout my studies and self-learning, I have gained proficiency in many programming languages, such as
                Java, Python, SQL, C, JavaScript, and many others, as well as the most important libraries and
                frameworks
                used in artificial intelligence, such as TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Hugging
                Face.
                Not only that, but I have also learned about the different algorithms used in machine learning, deep
                learning and natural language processing, such as SVM, KNN, K-means and K-medoids, neural networks....
            </p>
            <p>In this field, it is necessary to keep learning, and I am always looking for the latest developments in
                this
                fast changing world and how to improve to get the best results. </p>
            <p>I currently work at CDS, an HPE company, as a DevOps engineer while studying for a master's degree. As
                part
                of my job, I usually work with Python and Java as backend languages, and Angular for frontend
                development. I
                also have experience with Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins and many other tools used for Continuous
                Delivery/Continuous Integration (CD/CI), and unit test development. All of this using Agile, Scrum
                methodology. </p>

        <h2>Some personal projects</h2>
        <div class="project">
            <img src="./images/logo_QP.png" alt="Proyecto 1">
            <h3>BDP Project</h3>
            <p>It is an ambicious project that combine everything that i have learned plus new tecnologies that i want
                to work with.
            <p> By way of summary it is a website for a quiz game that will incorporate some machine learning techniques
                to enhance the gaming experience by giving them the possibility to see their statistics and compare them
                with those of other players. I am also going to use machine learning to give some course
                recommendations, in partnership with online academies in order to improve the user experience and give
                them the possibility to learn. </p>
            <p> I am also creating a neural network, a Transformer, which will solve some questions and will also play
                against users.
                also play against the users. </p>

            <p> For make this posible i am going to use the next tecnologies:
            <p>
            <p>- <b>Python:</b> using, pytorch, hugging face, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, flask, eventlet, socketio,
                sqlAlchemy.</p>
            <p>- <b>React</b></p>
            <p>- <b>Postgres SQL</b></p>

            <h3>CNN Sports Classifier</h3>
            <p> A project to practice vision computing with an Sports Dataset and Tensorflow
            <p> It is a CNN that is able to classify any photo as one of 100 sports that have been trained in.
                I have used the following dataset:</p>
