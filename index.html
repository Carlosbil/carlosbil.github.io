        <h2>Acerca de mí</h2>
        <p>Hello everybody and welcome to my web page. I'm Carlos Bilbao, computer engineer by the Polytechnic University of Madrid, and I'm currently studying a Master in Artificial Intelligence at the Alfonso X el Sabio University. I love learning new things, improving myself, and giving the best of me in every project I participate in. I am always looking for ways to improve different projects and determine the best approach for each problem.</p>
        <p>Throughout my studies and self-learning, I have gained proficiency in many programming languages, such as Java, Python, SQL, C, JavaScript, and many others, as well as the most important libraries and frameworks used in artificial intelligence, such as TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Hugging Face. Not only that, but I have also learned about the different algorithms used in machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing, such as SVM, KNN, K-means and K-medoids, neural networks....</p>
        <p>In this field, it is necessary to keep learning, and I am always looking for the latest developments in this fast changing world and how to improve to get the best results.    </p>
        <p>I currently work at CDS, an HPE company, as a DevOps engineer while studying for a master's degree. As part of my job, I usually work with Python and Java as backend languages, and Angular for frontend development. I also have experience with Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins and many other tools used for Continuous Delivery/Continuous Integration (CD/CCI), and unit test development. All of this using Agile, Scrum methodology.            </p>
