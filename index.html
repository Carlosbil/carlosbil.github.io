        <h2>Acerca de mí</h2>
        <p>Hi! Welcome to my web, I am Carlos Bilbao, a Computer engineer studied in Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, and currently studying a 
            Master in Artificial Intelligence in the Universidad Alfonso X el Sabio.I loves to learn new things and improve my self giving  all of
            my self in every project I am involved. As part of me, i am always looking how to upgrade the things that have been done, and how could be 
            the best way to approach every problem. 
            As part of my studies and my self learning, i have learned many languages, such as Java, Python, C, JavaScript, and many others, and also the most important
            libraries and frameworks used for artificial intelligence, such as Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch, numpy, Scikit-learn, Huggingface. Not only that, i have learned about 
            the different algorithms used for machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, such as SVM, KNN, K-means, K-medoids. 
            In this world it is really important to keep learning and i am always searching the latests news about this enviroment, and how to improve my self in order to give the best.

            Currently i am working on CDS, an HPE company as DevOps engineer while i am studying my master. As part of my job i use to work with Python and Java
            as backend languages, and Angular as frontend. I also have experience with Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and many other tools that are used to CD/CI.
