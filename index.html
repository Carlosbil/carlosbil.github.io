        <h2>Acerca de mí</h2>
        <p> Hi there! Welcome to my website. I am Carlos Bilbao, a computer engineer who studied at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, and I am currently studying a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at Universidad Alfonso X el Sabio. I love learning new things and improving myself, and giving my best into every project I am involved in. I am always looking for ways to improve the different projects and determine the best approach to every problem. </p>
        <p> In the course of my studies and self-learning, I have acquired proficiency in many programming languages, such as Java, Python, SQL, C, JavaScript, and many others, as well as the most important libraries and frameworks used in artificial intelligence, such as TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Hugging Face. Not only that, but I have also learned about the different algorithms used in machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, such as SVM, KNN, K-means, and K-medoids. </p>
        <P> In this field, it is necesary to continue learning, and I am always searching for the latest news in this changing world and how to improve myself in order to get the best results.</p>
        <P>    Currently, I am working at CDS, an HPE company, as a DevOps engineer while I am studying for my master's degree. As part of my job, I usually work with Python and Java as backend languages, and Angular for frontend development. I also have experience with Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and many other tools that are used for Continuous Delivery/Continuous Integration (CD/CI).</p>
